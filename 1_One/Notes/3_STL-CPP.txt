-> #include<bits/stdc++.h> : This will import all the things you would require while coding in CPP.

-> STL stands for Standard Template Library. It contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of containers and classes which makes it very easy for developers or programmers to implement different data structures easily without having to write complete code and worry about space-time complexities.

-> auto will automatically assign datatype to a value provided. You don't have to explicitly state any datatype.
Example: auto a = "Dirghayu"; //Automatically assigns string.
         auto num = 40;       //Automatically assigns integer.

-> sort() in C++ STL -> Sorting is one of the most standard operations used very frequently while writing programs. 

-> Writing the complete sorting algorithm might be time consuming and hence STL provides us with a standard inbuilt function to sort any container very easily.

-> And also itâ€™s one of the most efficient functions with a N*logN time complexity and uses a mix of quicksort and mergesort in its internal implementation.
