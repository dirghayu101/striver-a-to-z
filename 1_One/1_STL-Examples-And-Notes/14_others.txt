Other STL that might be used:

1. Unordered-multiset -> An unordered_multiset in STL is an associative container just like an unordered set the only difference is it can store duplicate elements in it.

2. Unordered-map -> unordered_map in STL are associative containers where each element consists of a key value and a mapped value. Two mapped values cannot have the same key value. The elements can be in any order.

3. multimap -> multimap in STL are associative containers like maps where each element consists of a key value and a mapped value, the only difference is multimaps can store duplicate elements
